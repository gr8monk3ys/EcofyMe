## General info
This project is a way of incentivising people into choosing to take care of our environment. We implement Google Maps API technologies in order to determine different event handlers such as markers that identify what types of events are going on throughout the world where we may be able to volunteer. The way that we innovate in incentivizing people to go out and create/join/host these events is by giving them a version of our very own crypto currency called Ecocoin. Our current version has not implemented a real version of ecoCoin on the market due to the cost of testing the coin in an environment. 

When people enter our web application, they can choose to do so on their mobile or desktop device due to the implementation of the Bootstrap framework which makes viewing our web application far more asthetically pleasing and significantally easier to work with compared to other frameworks that are out there.

When it comes down to the backend aspect of our code, we have stored and made all of our calls using Google Firebase so that we may be able to store all of the user's information as well as their location based on the Google maps API. We implemented a system that is similar to a social network so that individuals may come together in order to help make our environment a better place.   

## Setup
